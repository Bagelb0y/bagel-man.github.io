<p>In 1955 the Soviet Union and the United States were competing in a ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race. Eventually, this morphed into a competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability. Many citizens of the U.S. didn’t see the point in this race and thought their money could be allocated to things a little closer to home. In 1969 July 16, a day before the launch of Apollo 11, a group of civil rights activists protested the moon landing. They argued that the money could be spent helping people in poverty by providing food and shelter. Because of this protest, NASA developed technologies to make better housing using the insulation from spaceships, but it was more of an advertising stunt and didn’t amount to much. This protest did still raise awareness, which eventually led to more government spending on helping people in need, and the end of the Apollo missions. Without this protest, America wouldn’t be as far as we are today for providing equal opportunities for everyone.<p>

	<h2 class="quoteleft">“The single mention of a lunar module touching down brought boo’s from the audience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The Times</h2>
	<p class="debate">One day before the launch of Apollo 11, Ralph David Abernathy Sr, a civil rights activist and Baptist minister, led 25 poor families to the Kennedy Space Center to protest the launch of Apollo 11. Calling out America’s distorted sense of priorities, the families brought wagons drawn by mules. The mules’ contrast between the gleaming Saturn V rocket represented the difference between the billions spent on the space program and the poor families who couldn’t afford bare necessities.</p>

  <p class="column">The protesters thought that the amount of spending on the space race was unjustified. Billions of dollars were spent on the competion to develop missles and other war technologies, while people were starving on the steet. What's the point in competing in a competion with another nation, when our own nation is falling apart?
    </p>
	<p class="column2">The Government thought that the money was well spent, developing important technologies, and showing the Soviet Union they wouldn't back down from a challenge. If we don't develop missles and satelites, the Soviet Union could attack us and we wouldn't be prepared. This is a race to protect our country and our beliefs.</p>

  <h1>Effects</h1>
  <p>Despite all of the protests, NASA still continued with the moonshot. On July 16, 1969, NASA launched the shuttle carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Eight days later on July 24, they landed on the moon, which some argue ended the space race. Although another argument could be made that the USSR won because of the very little spending compared to NASA’s spending and the clear advantage they had. The entire point of the space race was to see who could be the first to develop satellites and ballistic missiles so they could prove their economy was better.
    But this protest did do something, or else I wouldn’t be talking about it. NASA tried to keep the promises they made on the day of the protest. Engineers took sensors initially used to detect contaminants in space, and used them to measure the urban air pollution. Another project they took on was taking the insulation from the space crafts and using that to make walls for building. Although looking at the actual effects this made, it seemed more like a publicity stunt. It wasn’t geared towards actually helping people, just making themselves look good so other people would support them.
    The Space Race did have benefits in many different areas. The Global Positioning System (GPS) that was originally developed by the military for precise navigation and weapon targeting systems, is now used as a tool by many people. It can be used to navigate to different places, or to know where other people are. Artificial limbs were also dramatically improved by using the advanced shock absorbing space technology invented. Deep space exploration missions also needed high quality cameras and image processors, which we also use almost everyday. Tons of technology was created from the Space Race, which really boosted the advancement of technology. Wireless headsets, LED lighting, freeze dried foods, cordless vacuums, scratch resistant eyeglass lenses, and memory foam were some of the big inventions that came from the space race. Also the satellites that were created that eventually led to the invention of the internet, which is a giant resource that billions of people use on a daily basis. The ability to interact with other people from across the world was a revolutionary product.
    Because of not only the protest at the Kennedy Space Center, but also all of the other protests throughout the 60’s, things started to change for the better. Poverty declined to much lower than it used to be, and government spending on poverty went up. More companies started hiring different types of people, leading to more diverse workplaces. The 60’s also shifted Americans views on civil rights, equality for all genders, and gay rights. These protests demanded that Americans consider equality for everyone in the nation. Eventually, people began to accept the basic goals of the sixties feminists. Women got equal pay for equal work, an end to domestic violence, some lift on the severe limits in managerial jobs, and the share of responsibility for housework and the care of children. Same-sex marriage was still being denied, but cases where popping up of unofficial gay marriages. States slowly applied laws that would give benefits, and try to protect same-sex marriages. After many long years, the supreme court eventually legalized same-sex marriage in all states in 2015.
    While all of this is certainly better than it used to be, we still have a long way to go to completely get rid of the biased, foreign policy America has established. Racism still exists in America, and non-white people aren’t given as fair as chances as white people. Sexism still exists with some people not accepting that every gender is equal. And homophobia is still a large struggle that people are still fig
