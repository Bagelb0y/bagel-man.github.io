  <h1>THESIS</h1>

	
	<img src="https://www.seti.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/earth-view-from-moon-perspective-footprints-1400px.jpg" style="width:50%">

<p >In 1955 the Soviet Union and the United States were competing in a ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race. Eventually, this morphed into a competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability. Many citizens of the U.S. didn’t see the point in this race and thought their money should be allocated to things a little closer to home.<p>
  <p>On July 15, 1969, a day before the launch of Apollo 11, a group of civil rights activists gathered together to protest the moon landing. They argued that the money could be spent helping people in poverty by providing food and shelter. Because of this protest, NASA developed technologies to make better housing using the insulation from spaceships, but it was more of an advertising stunt and didn’t amount to much. This protest did still raise awareness, which eventually led to more government spending on helping people in need, and the end of the Apollo missions. Without this protest, America's many social issues might of gone unnoticed.<p>

	<h2 class="quoteleft">“The single mention of a lunar module touching down brought boos from the audience.” -The Times</h2>

	<p class="debate">One day before the launch of Apollo 11, Ralph David Abernathy Sr, a civil rights activist and Baptist minister, led 25 poor families to the Kennedy Space Center to protest the launch of Apollo 11. Calling out America’s distorted sense of priorities, the families brought wagons drawn by mules. The mules’ contrast between the gleaming Saturn V rocket represented the difference between the billions spent on the space program and the poor families who couldn’t afford bare necessities.</p>

</audio>
		  <p class="caption">This is a song written by Gil Scott-Heron in 1970 that talks about how the government only cared about putting a man on the moon while people couldn't afford basic expenses.<p>


  <p class="column">The protesters thought that the amount of spending on the space race was unjustified. Billions of dollars were spent on the competion to develop missiles and other war technologies, while people were starving on the street. What's the point in competing in a competion with another nation, when our own nation is falling apart?
    </p>
	<p class="column2">The Government thought that the money was well spent, developing important technologies, and showing the Soviet Union they wouldn't back down from a challenge. If we don't develop missiles and satelites, the Soviet Union could attack us and we wouldn't be prepared. This is a race to protect our country and our beliefs.</p>

       <h1>DIPLOMACY</h1>
	     <img id="sus" src="https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTY1NDA1NTMwNDc3NTY5NTYx/apollo-protest_ap_392138814198.webp">
	     <p class="caption">This image shows Thomas Paine wearing a mini "hangmans noose" given to him by Reverend Ralph Abernathy that read, "I Helped Hang Poverty"
       <p id="sus2"> To combat the peacful protesters, NASA sent out an administrator named Thomas Paine. Abernathy talked to Paine about why the moon landing was negatively affecting the country. He told Paine that he had three requests from NASA: that ten familes from his group could veiw the launch, NASA should support the movemnt to combat this nations poverty, hunger, and other social problems, and that NASA engineers develop technologies to help combat the problem of hunger in America. 
      </p>
	     <p class="debate">Paine replied saying,<stong> "If we could solve the problems of poverty in the United States by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button."</strong> Paine also told Abernanthy that he wished he would  “hitch his wagons to our rocket, using the space program as a spur to the nation to tackle problems in other areas, and using NASA’s space successes as a yardstick by which progress in other areas should be measured.” The protest then ended with the two men in agreeance, Paine gave Abernanthy 10 VIP viewing tickets, and promised him they would make good on their promises. Abernanthy then replied saying he hoped for the astronauts saftey and that he was as proud as anyone for the great accomplisment.</p>
	    <h2 class="quoteleft">"On the eve of man's noblest venture, I am profoundly moved by the nation's achievements in space and the heroism of the three men embarking for the moon. But, what we can do for space and exploration we demand that we do for starving people."</h2>

  <h1>EFFECTS</h1>
  <p>Despite the protest, NASA still continued with the moonshot. On July 16, 1969, NASA launched the shuttle carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Eight days later on July 24, they landed on the moon, which some argue ended the space race. Although another argument could be made that the USSR won because of the very little spending compared to NASA’s spending and the clear advantage they had. The entire point of the space race was to see who could be the first to develop satellites and ballistic missiles so they could prove their economy was better.</p>

	  <p class="caption">This is a audio clip of Neil Armstong saying the famous words when he landed on the moon, "Thats one step for man. One giant leap for man kind."</p>
<p class="debate">NASA did some work to  develop technology that would benefit the poor. They took sensors originally used to detect contaminants in space, and modified them to analyze urban air pollution. They also used the insulation from space crafts to build walls that retained more heat. These efforts were soon abandoned until the 1980’s.</p>
	<h2 class="quoteleft">"It was more of an advertising effort." -Maher Abernanthy<h2>

		<h2 class="debate">“We must build on the successes of the past, always reaching out for new achievements. But we must also recognize that many critical problems here on this planet make high priority demands on our attention and our resources.” President Nixon, March 7, 1970.</h2>
		<p class="quoteleft">This protest did help to eventually end the Space Race, three moon landings later. When NASA pushed to get a moon base developed that could help benefit on missions to Mars, Nixon declined them. There was not a need to develop and more space technologies, seeing that the Cold War was over. The spending and political debates and arguments were not worth it, leading to the last astronaut to walk on the moon leaving on December 7, 1972.</p>
		<p class="end">Developing technology is always important, but when that technology gets in the way of our basic needs, it's gone too far. At the height of the Space Race, there were millions of Americans who didn’t have access to basic needs like water and adequate shelter and yet, we still put our resources towards developing new technology. This problem remains relevant today. The most wealthy build rockets for themselves, while their employees work for minimum pay in poor conditions. We need to find a way to continue to advance technology while using our resources to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity and can live safely. If we don’t do this, we fail to be what America stands for.</p>
