    <h1>secret games, dont tell the donuts</h1>
    <h1>I added a bunch of games that are actually fun</h1>
    <h2>The greatest flash game ever has been added, run 3</h2>
    <p>Im sorry everyone, the trainer didn't end up working, who couldve guessed that pressing a button doesn't magically train an army. But that doesn't matter. We need to prepare to take over the donuts on the day of halloween. I don't know how, but I do know we need some help from the muffins. Pleas convince them to help at this email: muffinsarecool69420@gmail.com</p>

   
<h2>Do you have a game you want to see on here? Email weirdwontons@gmail.com the name, description, and files/link for your game, and I'll add it!</h2>
